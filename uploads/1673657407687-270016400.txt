Welcome! If you're reading this, then you probably want to edit my shader pack.
I'm completely cool with this. In fact, to help you get started faster, here's an overview of how stuff works:
If you're on an old version of minecraft and just want to know all the places where you need to change a specific option, you can skip to the options section below.
If on the other hand you want to alter this pack for your own *personal* use, continue reading.

The first thing I'd like to point out is that in this download, there's a "shaders" folder, and a "src" folder.
The src folder is what I modify when developing these shaders, and the shaders folder is what my compile script spits out.
The main difference between them is that my compile script automatically collapses all #include's,
because the original shaders mod didn't have support for them and I never bothered to remove this feature in newer versions.
It also removes useless code, unused uniforms/constants/methods, etc... and generates this readme file.
As such, if you want to modify my shaders, I'd recommend removing the shaders folder, and renaming the src folder to "shaders" instead.
This is not required, as both folders *should* work identically; but it is recommended since most lib files are used in multiple places.

If the change you want to make is as simple as just changing a number, there's a good chance I already have support for that.
See /shaders/lib/colorConstants.glsl for all the magic numbers which apply to all dimensions.
See /shaders/world(number)/lib/colorConstants.glsl for all the magic numbers which only apply to specific dimensions.
If the number you want to change isn't in any of these files, let me know and I'll add it.

composite.fsh controls rendering for most opaque objects. This includes main light levels, held lights, fog, etc...
It also does some preparations for infinite oceans, which are mostly handled in composite1.fsh.
Speaking of infinite oceans, they're also partially handled in skybasic; as it writes 0% opacity to the gaux1 buffer below the horizon.
This acts as the flag for where composite should fix colors/normal data, so that composite1 has the correct values.
Skybasic also handles most of the sky colors (see calculateSkyColor()). It also handles fancy stars and galaxies.
sunPathRotation is also set there. If you plan on changing this, you'll need to set it in both skybasic.fsh AND vsh.
This is due to a bug in optifine, where sun/moon positions are actually one frame behind where they should be.
I fix this by calculating their positions manually; but to do that, sunPathRotation needs to be the same in the fsh and vsh stages.

A few effects are handled in the gbuffers files, such as:
gbuffers_block handles ender portals
gbuffers_entities handles rainbow XP, circular shadows, and entity coloring (the red tint when an entity take damage)
gbuffers_terrain handles all of the foliage effects, as well as wet dirt, randomized lava brightness, and lava waves (in the nether)
gbuffers_weather handles waving rain

gbuffers_water and hand handle most of the transparent stuff, in the same way that composite handles opaque stuff. This includes lighting/fog/etc...
Both of them write normal data to gnormal, which is used in composite1.fsh for sun/sky reflections.
hand also handles hand sway.

Most of the other fancy effects (like clouds, water refractions, etc...) are handled in composite1.
The only exceptions being ender nebulae/stars and twilight forest auroras, which are handled in world1/composite.fsh and world7/composite.fsh respectively.

Composite2 and final are used for blur effects. 2 programs are needed because I'm using a technique called 2-pass blurring.
First, blur horizontally, then blur vertically. Sounds simple, but is MUCH better on framerate than trying to do both at once.
This is because only doing horizontal blur requires ~(2 * radius) sample points, as does vertical blur.
Therefore, we need ~(4 * radius) sample points total.
If we did it all in one pass, we'd need ~(2 * radius) ^ 2 sample points, which is much larger.

That's all the effects, now for the used buffers:

gcolor: Stores color of opaque objects.
composite: Stores the color of transparent objects, and the opacity of the closest transparent object to the camera.
gnormal: Stores normal vectors of the closest transparent object to the camera (used for refractions and reflections)
gaux1: Red and green store block light and skylight of opaque objects. Blue is always 1.0.
	An opacity of 0.5 flags it as being part of the sky.
	An opacity of 0.0 flags it as being part of the lower half of the sky. (for infinite oceans)
gaux2: Red and green store block light and skylight of the closest transparent object to the camera.
	Used for not doing reflections when underground.
	The blue channel also stores block data, used for block-specific effects like better stained glass, water refractions, ice scattering, etc...
gaux3: Red stores the combined opacity of all transparent objects.

However, after all the composite programs run, these usages change quite drastically.

composite (the program, not the buffer) will first transfer the red channel of gaux3 (combined opacity of all transparent objects) to the alpha channel of gcolor.
	It also updates gnormal and gaux2 data for infinite oceans.
Next, composite1 will store the final color and blur radius in gaux3.
composite2 then applies horizontal blurring to gaux3, and writes the new horizontally blurred color to composite (the buffer, not the program).
Lastly: final will apply vertical blurring to composite, and write the result directly to the screen.

With all this in mind, you should have a fairly decent grasp on where everything is.

If you have any other questions about how specific features are implemented, or why I chose the equations I did, you can ask me about it on discord: https://discord.gg/FMghhxk
I'd be happy to help you figure stuff out, and if I like your changes, they might even get implemented officially :)

With all that out of the way, here's all the options you can set, and where to find them: Alphabetized here for convenience.
